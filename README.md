This is a smart contract built on the Solidity language that has implemented a basic token system with minting and burning capability. 
The defining public elements include; name of the token, abbreviation and total supply. It also involves mapping to monitor the balances for each address.
Constituents:
Public Variables:
Tokenname: An instance of a string that is representing the name of the token which is set to "ANSH".
Tokenabbr: A string representation of the token abbreviation which equals “ASH”.
totalsup: An unsigned integer type that represents the total supply of tokens initialized to 0.
Mapping:
balances: The Token Balance mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.
Functions:
mint(address adr, uint val): This function increases the total supply of tokens and credits those tokens in the given address.
This function contains two parameters which are an address, and value increments both total supply as well as an address by given value.
burn(address adr, uint val): If sufficient balance exists at this address then it burns some tokens out of this specified location.
This function needs an address, value subtracts from this particular address’s balance while reducing totalsupply.
Error Handling:
Although the burn function has a condition that checks if the address has enough tokens to burn, there is a mistake in the burn function 
where it wrongly increases the balance and total supply, instead of decreasing them. The right implementation should decrease totalsup and balances[adr].
Summary:
This contract provides a simple token system that includes mints and burns which can be used to increase or decrease total supply as well as manage balances. 
But there is an error in the burning process that must be addressed for it to correctly reduce both balance and total supply.
